## GoF Design Patterns reminder with examples.
[Demo](https://sash-ua.github.io/gof-design-patterns/)

TypeScript examples are integrated into the app.
For example - bridge pattern.
1. A files with a code example are in `app/modules/structural/bridge/services/bridge`
2. `bridge.ts` contains how to use. Uncomment to see in the console a check.
3. Bridge service injected in the bridge component `app/modules/structural/bridge/components/bridge.component.ts`

## Contributing
It would be good if you contribute to the repository and add new examples in different programming languages.
The example should be as a not compiled, not zipped file added to an appropriate folder.
For instance. Example of `chain-of-responsibility` pattern should be added to:
`app/modules/behavioral/chain-of-responsibility/services/chain-of-responsibility`
The file's name should differ from files in the folder.

Thank you!
